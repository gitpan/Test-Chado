=head2 Integrating Test::Chado with existing or new distribution

It assumes you to have or to create a new perl distribution with standard folder structure. 
Minimally, it should have a B<lib> and B<t> folders. For a new distribution, create one with B<module-starter>. 

    module-starter --module=TestChado::WithMakeFile --author="Siddhartha Basu" --email=sidd.basu@gmail.com                                                              rbenv:system 
    Added to MANIFEST: Changes
    Added to MANIFEST: ignore.txt
    Added to MANIFEST: lib/TestChado/WithMakeFile.pm
    Added to MANIFEST: Makefile.PL
    Added to MANIFEST: MANIFEST
    Added to MANIFEST: README
    Added to MANIFEST: t/00-load.t
    Added to MANIFEST: t/boilerplate.t
    Added to MANIFEST: t/manifest.t
    Added to MANIFEST: t/pod-coverage.t
    Added to MANIFEST: t/pod.t
    Created starter directories and files

The distribution will look like the following ...

    TestChado-WithMakeFile
    |-- Changes
    |--ignore.txt
    |-- lib
    |   |-- TestChado
    │       |-- WithMakeFile.pm
    |-- Makefile.PL
    |-- MANIFEST
    |-- README
    |-- t
        |-- 00-load.t
        |-- boilerplate.t
        |-- manifest.t
        |-- pod-coverage.t
        |-- pod.t

=head3 Using with Makefile.PL distribution

Create or edit an existing Makefile and add the L<Test::Chado> dependency.

=head4 Makefile.PL

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;

    WriteMakefile(
        NAME                => 'TestChado::WithMakeFile',
        AUTHOR              => q{Siddhartha Basu <sidd.basu@gmail.com>},
        VERSION_FROM        => 'lib/TestChado/WithMakeFile.pm',
        ABSTRACT_FROM       => 'lib/TestChado/WithMakeFile.pm',
            ($ExtUtils::MakeMaker::VERSION >= 6.3002
                ? ('LICENSE'=> 'perl')
                : ()),
        PL_FILES            => {},
        PREREQ_PM => {
            'Test::Chado' => '1.0.0'
        },
        dist                => { COMPRESS => 'gzip -9f', SUFFIX => 'gz', },
        clean               => { FILES => 'TestChado-WithMakeFile-*' },
    );

Install dependencies using B<cpanm> or any other standard installer

    cpanm --installdeps .

Then write your tests in B<t/> folder as usual run it with make

    perl Makefile.PL && make test

=head3 Using with Build.PL distribution

Create or edit an existing B<Build.PL> and add the L<Test::Chado> dependency.

=head4 Build.PL

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Module::Build;


    my %module_build_args = (
        "configure_requires" => {
            "Module::Build" => "0.3601"
         },
        "dist_abstract" => "Toy distribution with Build.PL",
        "dist_author" => [
                "Siddhartha Basu <biosidd\@gmail.com>"
            ],
        "dist_name" => "TestChado-WithBuildPL",
        "dist_version" => "1.0.0",
        "license" => "perl",
        "module_name" => "TestChado::WithBuildPL",
        "requires" => { 'Test::Chado' => '1.0.0'}
    );

    my $build = Module::Build->new(%module_build_args);
    $build->create_build_script;

Install dependencies with B<cpanm>, write tests and run as usual

    perl Build.PL && ./Build test
